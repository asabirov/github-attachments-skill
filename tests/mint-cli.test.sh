# Every case here is a refusal that happens before a browser starts. That is the point:
# a bad --repo or a 12 MB file should cost nothing, and the failure that actually hurt in
# testing was an over-size image that uploaded for a minute and then timed out, because
# GitHub rejects on size after the transfer rather than before it.
