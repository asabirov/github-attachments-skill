// The whole upload, as one expression a browser can evaluate.
//
// GitHub has no API for this. The web UI POSTs to github.com/upload/policies/assets
// with a session cookie and a CSRF token, gets back a signed S3 policy, uploads there,
// and is handed back a github.com/user-attachments/assets/<uuid> reference. A personal
// access token cannot reach that endpoint: tried 2026-09-03 against a real repository id
// and it answered 422 with GitHub's generic error page, not a policy. So the only way in
// is a page that is already signed in.
//
// Rather than reimplement that three-step dance and re-break it every time GitHub moves
// the endpoint, this hands a File to the editor's own paste handler and lets GitHub's
// JavaScript do the upload it already knows how to do. The editor writes the finished
// reference into its textarea, and we read it back out.
//
// Two editors exist and both take a paste. The classic issue and PR pages use textareas
// named new_comment_field and fc-<resource>-body; the newer /issues/new page is a React
// editor whose textarea has a generated id and no file input at all. Matching on the
// placeholder and the id together covers both without knowing which one loaded.
//
// Deliberately not used: orca upload / CDP DOM.setFileInputFiles. It needs the real
// input element, and GitHub keeps that input out of the accessibility tree behind an
// "Attach files" button, so the ref never resolves. On /issues/new there is no file
// input to find at all.
